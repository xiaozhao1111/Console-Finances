Creating code for analyzing the financial records of a companyã€‚


## Description
In this project, a financial profit datasheet of a company was provided in a index.js. We'll use Javascript skills to generate an analysis report.

The datasheet is composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. The task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. PS: the changes in Profit/Losses of the first month in the datasheet are equal to the value of the Profit/Losses.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## The format of the resulting analysis

* The result should look similat to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

* The financial analysis report should be printed to the console. As a bonus, the financial datasheet and analysis report were also dispalyed in the webpage.
